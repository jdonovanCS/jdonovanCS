- 👋 Hi, I’m @jdonovanCS
- 👀 I’m interested in just about everything, but especially evolutionary computation, coevolution, neuroevolution, and openendedness (especially evolutionary).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at the University of Vermont and will soon start my dissertation research on a topic relating to the above interests.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything, time allowing.
